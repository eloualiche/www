<strong>Abstract:</strong>
<!-- <font  size="3"  > -->
We study how firms allocate resources between their constituent establishments
during the Great Depression. To do this, we construct an establishment-level
dataset from the Census of Manufactures for a select set of industries and link
the establishment into their parent companies. We examine the sensitivity of
establishment-level employment to changes in local demand and financial
conditions across single and multi-plant firms. We find that employment in
establishments that are a part of a multi-plant firm is more highly correlated
with demand than that of a single-plant. At the same time, employment at
multi-plant firms is less correlated with financial conditions. We also find
that shocks to establishment in one particular region spillover to plants that
are part of the same firm but located in a different region. We develop a model
of firm networks to interpret these results as evidence for the importance of
internal firm networks in channeling resources across space in response to
changes in local conditions. We also show how this model explains the empirical
fact that employment at multiplant establishments and firms is more volatile
than employment at single plant establishments (and firms).
